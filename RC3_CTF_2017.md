When we access the site, it starts redirecting to different URLs in succession very quickly, so I turned to curl to access the site instead of a browser. Doing so, we discover that there is a hidden character in what comes back, and chasing each URL it points to we can uncover a hidden message.

Opening up the PDF we see the following:

This just smells of a book cipher, but what book can we use? Well, looking at the first letter of each word in the table, we find that it spells out "GUTENBERGDICTIONARYBYVARIOUS". We can access this dictionary on the net, and then we can look up each word one by one, and then use the page numbers to correspond to the letter in the definition of the word. Doing this gives us our solution:

"yoursolutionisfindingmeaning"

And the flag ends up being "findingmeaning"

The clue here is chemistry, and we are going to use the periodic table to decode this one.
Using the periodic table as a guide, we look up the corresponding elements where each color block is.

We get:
Be S Ga Se Er

Doesn't spell anything out directly, but if we organize them according to ROYGBIV (per the colors in the table) we get our flag:

"beergases"

Downloading the pcap file we can follow the tcp stream and immediately see there is an image. We can rebuild this by looking at what objects we can export as HTTP.

Opening up the image we get our flag!
